# CSP4CMSIS Demo for NUCLEO-G474RE

A demonstration of the CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) library for CMSIS-RTOS v2 on STM32G474RE microcontroller. The formal model is available [here](https://github.com/OliverFaust/CSP4CMSIS_for_NUCLEO-G474RE/tree/develop/Formal%20model).

## Features
- FreeRTOS with CMSIS-RTOS v2 API
- CSP4CMSIS library for channel-based communication
- Rendezvous synchronization pattern
- Static memory allocation (zero heap usage)
- Serial console output via USART1

## Hardware Requirements
- STM32 Nucleo-G474RE board
- USB cable for programming and serial communication

## Serial Configuration
- Baud Rate: 115200
- Data Bits: 8
- Stop Bits: 1
- Parity: None

## Building with STM32CubeIDE
1. Clone this repository. Any directory will do but not the STM32CubeIDE workspace. 
2. Open STM32CubeIDE
3. File → Import → Existing Projects into Workspace
4. Select this directory
5. Build and flash to your Nucleo board

## Project Structure
- `Core/` - Application source code
- `Drivers/` - STM32 HAL drivers
- `lib/CSP4CMSIS/` - CSP library
- `Middlewares/` - FreeRTOS middleware
